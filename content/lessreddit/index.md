### What's this?

This extension will randomly fade out YT and reddit at unpredictable intervals. I found it to be more successful and less jarring than other apps.

Due to ~~popular~~ occasional demand, I'm hosting this Chrome extension to easily share it with the lost souls who need it.

Since Reddit and Youtube take [full advantage of your dopamine](https://www.google.com/search?q=intermittent+reward) to keep you coming back, it's only fair to take advantage of your cortisol in response.

### Why?

Other methods are too hardcore, too fussy or too easily disabled.

### How to use

1. Download the extension folder [from here](https://vlad.ai/files/enoughreddit.zip) and unzip it wherever
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions` in Chrome's URL bar
3. Switch on "Developer Mode" (top-right)
4. Click "Load Unpacked"
5. Select the folder where you unzipped extensions files

### What stops me from disabling it?

Nothing. But if that's a problem, try copying that folder multiple times and loading multiple copies of the extension to Chrome so that it becomes too much work to toggle them on and off. I imagine doing that enough times will cause the pages to crash instead of fading out though. I'll fix it later. 

### I'm still unproductive!

If you use a mac, try the nuclear option with [SelfControl](https://selfcontrolapp.com/) app. If you don't use a mac, discard your machine into the trash taking care to remove the lithium ion battery ([although, maybe you should throw it away](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/07/200727145824.htm)), then get a mac.
